# Squadbase Starter Templates

A collection of production-ready starter templates for building modern internal web applications with [Squadbase](https://www.squadbase.dev).

## Squadbase

Squadbase is a platform to turn web application built with frameworks like Next.js, Streamlit, etc. into a full-fledged internal web application with just a git push.
Authentication, RBAC, log monitoring, analytics and more are all built-in. You cat get all of them without adding an extra line of code.

## Overview

Squadbase Starter Templates provide pre-configured, framework-specific templates to jumpstart your web application development. Each template is designed with best practices, modern tooling, and ready-to-deploy configurations.

Vibe coding with LLMs is an excellent way to customize these templates. Starting from a plain boilerplate for each framework can make it harder to set up a solid starter layout. With these templates, you can skip the tedious scaffolding and jump straight into building your app.
Pairing them with an LLM lets you iterate quickly and shape your project to fit your needs from the very beginning.
