## Ready to customize your CRM with Claude‚ÄØCode?

CRM is vital but usually overpriced and hard to bend to your process.

Our open‚Äësource, self‚Äëhosted CRM pairs with Claude‚ÄØCode, letting anyone refactor fields, workflows, and automations in plain language‚Äîno vendor lock‚Äëin or proprietary scripts.

Result: zero license fees, total data control, and a CRM that fits your business in hours, not months.

## Installation

### One-click Deployment

Deploy your own Squadbase CRM instance with a single click. Squadbase automatically provides authentication and access control for secure CRM operations. You can start using it for free if you have less than 5 members.

[![Deploy to Squadbase](https://app.squadbase.dev/button.svg)](https://app.squadbase.dev/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/squadbase/squadbase-starters/tree/main/crm/nextjs&env-var-keys=POSTGRES_HOST,POSTGRES_PORT,POSTGRES_USER,POSTGRES_PASSWORD,POSTGRES_DATABASE,LANGUAGE,CURRENCY)

#### PostgreSQL Setup

Squadbase CRM requires only PostgreSQL.
[Neon](https://neon.com/) is our recommended PostgreSQL hosting service where you can easily deploy your own PostgreSQL instance.

Database migrations are handled automatically via `npm run build`.
This command will be triggered in squadbase when you push to the repository.

For Squadbase's build and deployment environments, allow IP communication to automatically configure the database on Postgres and launch the CRM.

Please configure the following IP addresses in your PostgreSQL whitelist:

- **Build Server:** `54.150.149.0`
- **App Server:**
After deployment, check the Allow IPs screen and configure the IP addresses.
[Details here](https://www.squadbase.dev/en/docs/features/fixed-ip-addresses).
